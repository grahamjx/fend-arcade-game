#FEND-arcade-game

This arcade game clone is similar to the classic "Frogger". A player moves their
character while trying to avoid getting hit by enemies. It was created as part of
Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program.

### How-to

The player uses the arrow keys to move up, right, left and down.
The goal is to get as many points as possible before running out of lives.

Reach the water: **+100 Points!**

Pick-up a _Star_ or _Key_ Item: **+200 Points!**

Pick-up a _Heart_ Item: **+1 Life**

Get hit by an enemy: **-100 Points and -1 Life**
